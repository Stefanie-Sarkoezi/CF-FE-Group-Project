## Task description for this group pßroject:

For this project, you will need to build a landing page for the new CodeFactory’s courses.

What we need: The landing page should be reusable, which means the same design can be used for the multiple courses. The purpose of the page is to give all necessary information about the course, which includes:

- Course topic explanation

- Testimonials

- Videos

- Information about the teacher

- Information about the course space

- Information about the course technologies

- News section

- Price offers

- Different course formats (f.e. Intro, Basic, Advanced)

- Links to the main website (codefactory.wien)

The purpose of the course landing page is to be a stand-alone page which will give all necessary information about the course. It would be good that the landing page is one page site with the modern design which gives clear information about the course for the target student. You don’t need to provide the course registration form, a button which leads to codefactory.wien registration page is only necessary.

Requirements: The landing page must be fully responsive (you are allowed to use 100% free theme elements if they are without any copyrighted restrictions and of course you must implement them in combination with your styles - using just prepared theme without your styles is not allowed). We also need one page/section with weekly or monthly news and updates, displayed in a list (like a blog) where the user can get additional information by clicking on the different pictures or links. Landing page, as well as a page news page, must have the option to display highlighting of the code syntax. The landing page should be reusable which means using variables for the page colors would be very welcomed.
